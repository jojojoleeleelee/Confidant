# Confidant

Confidant is a web application, serving those in need of a confidant. To quote our good 'ol buddy William Wordsworth, feel free to use this platform to 'fill your paper with the breathings of your heart.'

This is a platform that will guide you through your current emotions and enable to elaborate your concerns in further detail that you can post to your personal dashboard.

Last but not least, Confidant will serve as a trustworthy confidant by giving the user a customized feedback with words of true wisdom - quoting verses from the Bible.
